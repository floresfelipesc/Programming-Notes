Each computer within a network has a unique address to identify itself within the network.
This is called an IP Address (Internet Protocol Address).

Whenever a computer wants to communicate with another computer, it creates a packet
and sends that packet to the according computer.
These packets contains to main parts:
  Header: The IP Address of whoever the packet it for
  Payload: The data itself whether it be files, webpage, or requests for data.

These packets then travel from your computer, to the router, to whichever computer
it needs to go.
