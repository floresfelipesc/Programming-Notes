What is N Tier Architecture?
N Tier Architecture is separation of code into layers, most
often 3 distinct layers. UI Layer, Business Logic Layer, 
and Data Layer.

Typically used for general applications. Very versatile across
many types of applications.
Can turn to be tightly coupled if done improperly.

Will be using console application project type
as an example of how N Tier Architecture can be done.

UI Layer:
*Often Program.cs file
*Displays to user and Reads input from user
*Uses functions defined in Business Logic
to get things done (is a user of Business Logic)

Business Layer:
*Often a Class Library with classes
*Contains logic in a lot of functions
*Uses functions defined in Data to
retrieve data to use

Data Layer:
*Contains Data in variables and Models (custom made objects
that have a bunch of variables)
*Contains methods that exposes the data


UI Layers --uses--> Business Logic --uses--> Data Layer
