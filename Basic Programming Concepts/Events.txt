Events are a way for a single piece of code to notify many other pieces of code
to respond with their own execution. The piece of code who alerts others is 
called the "publisher", and the ones who respond to the signal are called the
"subscribers".

WHY TO USE: 
This is typically used to "wire up" logic in the background to respond to
user interaction (menus, mouse moving, mouse clicks). It Helps to decouple logic as 
long as the subscribing does not take place in the same file as the planned 
subscribers themselves. The publisher can fire off its signal, not caring about
who is listening without errors, and you can wire up as many subscribers as you want
to respond to that signal with neither of them knowing anything of each other.

HOW TO USE:
You can use Action\EventHandler\Func in order to initialize publishers IN WHICH WHO
declare the parameters of the subscribers they will call to when invoked. 
This means the generics/parameters used in publishers define the parameters of their
subscribers. 
Action is used to declare subscribers who takes in parameters you define
and output nothing.
EX: 
public event Action<double> myPublisher; //initialize
myPublisher?.Invoke(someDouble); //fire off signal, not caring about subscribers

in another file...
myPublisher += Method1; //the += operator is how you wire up a subscriber to publisher
myPublisher += Method2;
^
|
|
public void Method1(double x){} //subscribers who do not know of the publisher
public void Method2(double x){}


Function can be used when you also want your subscribers to return a data type.
This can be a bit weird though, as this is a one to many relationship, NOT a many
to one relationship. Be wary when doing this. 

public event Function<int, int> myFunction; //initialize
int x = myFunction?.Invoke(5); //fire off signal, not caring about subscribers

in another file...
myFunction += Square; //the += operator is how you wire up a subscriber to publisher
myFunction += Half;
^
|
|
public int Square(int x){} //subscribers who do not know of the publisher
public int Half(int x){}


EventHandler is used when you want the subscribers to have knowledge of the
publisher through their parameters, other data can be included in the parameter as
well. If you do not specify anything in their generics, the default parameters will 
be (Object sender, Eventargs e). 
Object sender is the publisher's data, Eventargs is the other data you'd like
to include. 

public event EventHandler<string> myEventHandler; //initialize
myEventHandler?.Invoke(this, randomString); //fire off signal, not caring about subs

myEventHandler += Method1; //the += operator is how you wire up a subscriber to publisher
myEventHandler += Method2;
^
|
|
public Method1(Object sender, string s){} //subscribers who do not know of the publisher
public Method2(Object sender, string s){} 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*The publisher is often within a method of itself, so typically the paramaters of 
the first method gets passed into the publisher which passes it to the subcribers.

**Remember to either subscribe to an event once or if you must do that several times,
unsubscribe from the event at some point. Do not accumulate subscriptions, this
causes memory leaks.
